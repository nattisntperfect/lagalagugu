        lyrics: "I'm falling out of love with you LA\nRunning out of reasons I should stay\nI'm overwhelmed, I'm over it\nIt's too cold here anyway\nI'm falling out of love with you LA\nBack to Alonica\nWhere the sun is out all the time\nMy favorite beach is there\nAnd the sand, it stretches for miles\nSinging la-di-di-di-da\nAnd slowly dancing 'til the morning comes\nI feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica\nDarling, I have finally settled in\nThe water's perfect for a midnight swim\nIt's paradise, the stars and I\nAre catching up like old friends\nMy heart is learning how to love again\nBack to Alonica\nWhere the sun is out all the time\nMy favorite beach is there\nAnd the sand, it stretches for miles\nSinging la-di-di-di-da\nAnd slowly dancing 'til the morning comes\nI feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica\nMade up of a thousand colors\nEverything is in its place\nI don't know the last time there were\nTears like this upon my face\nEvery artist falls in wonder\nEven Michelangelo\nIf God is really out there somewhere\nThis must be his other home\nBack to Alonica\nWhere the sun is out all the time\nMy favorite beach is there\nAnd the sand, it stretches for miles\nSinging la-di-di-di-da\nAnd slowly dancing 'til the morning comes\nI feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica"
